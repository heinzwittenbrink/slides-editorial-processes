::: notes

We all know these processes, and we all have experience with editorial processes that are not optimal. Conversely, good quality is also related to well-established editorial processes. We also want to gather a lot of our experience, with the questions:

Which factors outside the editorial office play a relevant role?
Where alternatives are possible?

# Web editing as a root of content strategy


## Editing as a component of content strategy

> As their content specialists, the more we know about solid editorial practices, the better we can help our clients with the transition to the new world of distributed online publishing. 

@kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 21

## Editing as a root of content strategy

> Editorial work is so closely related to content strategy that questions about the difference between the two often arise. From the outside, content strategy can look quite a lot like the sort of editing found in magazines and newspapers. The editorial world, and that of publishing in general, has a lot to offer us. 

@kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p.16

## The importance of editing

- Editors as delegates of the audience
- Editors as garants of quality
- Editors as packagers of information

## Roles of the content strategist and the editor in chief

> They also need someone to decide how best to communicate it, who should make it, and so on—a sort of combination editor-in-chief and air traffic controller. They need a content strategist. 

@kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p.1

## Content strategists as managing editors

> Those who do content strategy work from within organizations tend to fill roles quite similar to those of a traditional managing editor: they plan and oversee the communication of new themes and ideas, manage schedules, and collaborate with writers and other content producers. 

@kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p.69

## Examples

[Content strategist at the city of Leoben](https://www.fresh-content.at/content-strategie-im-oeffentlichen-bereich/ "Fresh Content Content Strategie im öffentlichen Bereich")

[Content Strategists: What Do They Do, Anyway? | Intergrowth™](https://inter-growth.co/content-marketing/content-strategist/ "Content Strategists: What Do They Do, Anyway? | Intergrowth™")

## Content strategies have to be translated into editorial decisions

- Dependencies of content strategies and contentent strategists from editors
- Content strategy is about channels, not items
- Content channels can only be managed by editors

## Why editorial is important

> In my experience, it is very easy for brilliant information architects (or UX people who do information architecture) to underestimate the importance of editorial planning, voice and tone, and detailed guidelines for content creation @kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 59

## Editors cannot be replaced by specialists

> If you rely on internal experts without a dedicated editor and approval process, you’re courting trouble. @kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 66

## Editing as necessary skill and craft

> But the truth is, none of these tools can replace a skilled in-house editor. If your client will be creating and managing more than a few dozen pages of content, they’ll need an editor or internal content strategist to keep things running smoothly. @kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 69

## Editing is about authority and leadership

> Content creation encompasses writing, illustration, information visualization, metadata and text-equivalent production, and interface writing, and is supported by creative direction and old-fashioned editorial leadership. @kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 62

## Editing as continuous handling of complex situations with unexpected components

> The essence of editorial work lies not in style guides and arguments about grammar, but in the ability to cultivate relationships, manage chaos, and serve readers. It’s not a profession to be learned from books, but these three very different takes will help. Kissane p. 78

## Real world editing

> But real-world editing is much more about crack organizational skills, a habit of developing practical communication ideas, and the ability to deal firmly and diplomatically with the whole crew of people involved in getting a book, newspaper, or website from concept to delivery. Kissane p. 17

## Tasks of editors and editorial teams

* maintaining consistency (often with style guides)
* correct language
* passion for getting the story
* development of themes and narrative arcs
* reactions to outside events
* managing writers and creators
* maintaining balanced variety

## Editors as advocates of the readers

> Editors worth their salt work not for writers or publishers, but for readers. Kissane (2011) p. 17

> Paradoxically, it’s only by working tirelessly for our readers that we can genuinely serve our clients and employers Kissane Kissane (2011) p. 18

> Acting as a user advocate doesn’t make you an impractical idealist. As we’ve learned from our editorial colleagues, if your content doesn’t work for the user, you’ve already failed. User advocacy is simply a way of ensuring that a project achieves business goals. •	 @kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 47

## Storytelling as a focus for editors

> Whatever corner of the publishing world they come from, editors know how to help other people tell the best, most engaging stories they can tell. Content people with backgrounds in journalism or publishing usually have the basics of storytelling down cold, but the rest of us can learn from the storytelling principles of these fields—from the basics like building a lead that hooks the reader (and supporting it with facts and quotations) to sophisticated techniques for layering in secondary narratives. @kissaneElementsContentStrategy2011 p. 18



## Discussion: Editing for print and digital

## Content and packaging

> Some lines of fair play can be drawn, but lightly. A manuscript's *content* … is the author's province … But the *form* of the final product–its organization, pace. packaging–is what editors like to think is their speciality.

::: notes

This a new article about a burning topic: a UN initiative to ban corporate greenwashing. The article states that a first guidline document published yesterday is totally insufficient. This is probaby understandable for an initiated audience, but certainly not for a normal reader of a quality newspaper website.
