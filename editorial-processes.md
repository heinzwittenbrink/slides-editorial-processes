::: notes

Wir kennen diese Prozesse alle, und wir haben alle Erfahrungen mit redaktionellen Prozessen, die nicht optimal sind. Umgekehrt hängt gute Qualität auch mit gut aufgesetzten redaktionellen Prozessen zusammen. Wir wollen heute auch viel unserer Erfahrungen zusammentragen, und zwar mit den Fragen:

Welche Faktoren außerhalb der Redaktion eine relevante rolle spielen
Wo Alternativen möglich sind.

# Content strategy and editing

## Editing as a component of content strategy

> As their content specialists, the more we know about solid editorial practices, the better we can help our clients with the transition to the new world of distributed online publishing. p. 21

##

> Editorial work is so closely related to content strategy that questions about the difference between the two often arise. From the outside, content strategy can look quite a lot like the sort of editing found in magazines and newspapers. The editorial world, and that of publishing in general, has a lot to offer us. Kissane p.16

## Die Relevanz der Redaktion, Redakteur:innen als Vertreter:innen der Lesenden

## Roles of the content strategist and the editor in chief

> They also need someone to decide how best to communicate it, who should make it, and so on—a sort of combination editor-in-chief and air traffic controller. They need a content strategist. Kissane, p.1

##

> Those who do content strategy work from within organizations tend to fill roles quite similar to those of a traditional managing editor: they plan and oversee the communication of new themes and ideas, manage schedules, and collaborate with writers and other content producers. Kissane p. 69

## Example

[Andere Kanäle „bedienen“ Sie auch?](https://www.fresh-content.at/content-strategie-im-oeffentlichen-bereich/ "Fresh Content Content Strategie im öffentlichen Bereich")

## Content strategies have to be translated into editorial decisions

- Dependencies of content strategies and contentent strategists from editors
- Content strategy is about channels, not items
- Content channels can only be managed by editors

## Why editorial is important

> In my experience, it is very easy for brilliant information architects (or UX people who do information architecture) to underestimate the importance of editorial planning, voice and tone, and detailed guidelines for content creation Kissane, p. 59

## Editors cannot be replaced by specialists

> If you rely on internal experts without a dedicated editor and approval process, you’re courting trouble. Kissane p. 66

# Editing as necessary skill and craft

> But the truth is, none of these tools can replace a skilled in-house editor. If your client will be creating and managing more than a few dozen pages of content, they’ll need an editor or internal content strategist to keep things running smoothly. Kissane p. 69

## Editing is about authority and leadership

> Content creation encompasses writing, illustration, information visualization, metadata and text-equivalent production, and interface writing, and is supported by creative direction and old-fashioned editorial leadership. Kissane, p. 62

## Editing as continuous handling of complex situations with unexpected components

> The essence of editorial work lies not in style guides and arguments about grammar, but in the ability to cultivate relationships, manage chaos, and serve readers. It’s not a profession to be learned from books, but these three very different takes will help. Kissane p. 78

##

> But real-world editing is much more about crack organizational skills, a habit of developing practical communication ideas, and the ability to deal firmly and diplomatically with the whole crew of people involved in getting a book, newspaper, or website from concept to delivery. Kissane p. 17

## Tasks of editors and editorial teams

* maintaining consistency (often with style guides)
* correct language
* passion for getting the story
* development of themes and narrative arcs
* reactions to outside events
* managing writers and creators
* maintaining balanced variety

## Editors as advocates of the readers

> Editors worth their salt work not for writers or publishers, but for readers. Kissane p. 17

> Paradoxically, it’s only by working tirelessly for our readers that we can genuinely serve our clients and employers Kissane p. 18

> Acting as a user advocate doesn’t make you an impractical idealist. As we’ve learned from our editorial colleagues, if your content doesn’t work for the user, you’ve already failed. User advocacy is simply a way of ensuring that a project achieves business goals. •	 Kissane p. 47

## Storytelling as a focus for editors

> Whatever corner of the publishing world they come from, editors know how to help other people tell the best, most engaging stories they can tell. Content people with backgrounds in journalism or publishing usually have the basics of storytelling down cold, but the rest of us can learn from the storytelling principles of these fields—from the basics like building a lead that hooks the reader (and supporting it with facts and quotations) to sophisticated techniques for layering in secondary narratives. Kissane p. 18

## Auswirkungen der Redaktionsstruktur auf die Inhalte

- Größe und Struktur der Redaktion wirken sich unmittelbar auf die Inhalte aus
- Die Redaktion entscheidet darüber, was wie thematisiert wird und was nicht
- Damit bestimmt sie, wie die Welt für die Rezipienten und auch die Organisation dargestellt wird
- Die Machtverhältnisse in der Redaktion und die Macht über die Reaktion sind für die Inhalte sehr relevant

## Redaktionsforschung, Redaktionen im Journalismus

## Editorial programs

1. Classification by rubrics/ressorts/departmentsio
2. Presentation of information
3. Generation and collection of information (sourcing, reporting etc.)
4. Selection of information by routines for decision and actions
5. Fact checking/verification

@kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

## ROI as limiting factor for editorial quality and credibility

- Example: private radio and tv station
- Conflicts between journalistic ambition and content marketing

## Research about coordination

One-to-one conversation as the most frequent form of coordination within editorial teams

## Defined eequirements and need for editorial coordination

The number of coordinating actions increases, when rules and guidelines decrease

## Coordination is required

Journalistic practice is not possible without coordination. Usually coordination is not institutionalized except staff conferences (Redaktionskonferenzen)

## Finegrained structures get out of use

> Altmeppen notes that at the level of organizational programs, differentiated structures are being replaced by roughly structured ones. This makes journalists' work more flexible; they can no longer rely on assignments to fixed departments and roles.

## Editorial processes

> you need an editorial process that will support creation, review and revision, publication, performance tracking, and ongoing maintenance. (You’re also going to need resources, primarily in the form of time, which gets paid for with money.) kissane p.21

## Editorial Tools

> Tools such as: •	 clearly documented editorial workflows, including approval processes and thorough quality checks; •	 editorial calendars including content campaigns and themes planned well in advance; and •	 content custom-tuned for specific channels and audiences. kissane p.21

Altmeppen stellt fest, dass auf der Ebene der Organisationsprogramme differenzierte Strukturen durch grobgliederige abgelöst werden. So wird die Arbeit der Journalisten flexibler, sie können sich nicht mehr auf die Zuordnungen zu festen Ressorts und Rollen verlassen. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:56:47   in Public
In seiner Studie über „Redaktionen als Koordinationszentren“35untersucht Altmeppen die so genannten „organisatorisch-dispositiven“36Tätigkeiten von Journalisten, also die Koordination journalistischer Arbeit @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

Redaktionsstruktur führt dazu, dass um Einfluss im System, und nicht gegen das System gekämpft wird. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

Konflikte in der Redaktion orientieren sich an den formalen Mitgliedsregeln, werden innerhalb der Redaktion ausgetragen und unterliegen den Kontrollen durch die formale Autorität im System, die jedoch die Funktion hat, das System gleichzeitig zu einigen.2@kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:55:04   in Public
5Die Autorität der Rollenträger setzt sich dabei aus dem persönlichen Einfluss, der an die Person des Redakteurs gebunden ist und aus der Autorität, die durch die Redaktion formalisiert und auf jedes Redak- tionsmitglied begrenzt ist, zusammen @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

redaktionsinternes Zweckprogramm führt Rühl die Redaktionsschlusszeiten an, als redaktionsexternes Zweckprogramm dient die Orientierung am „Gemeinwohl“. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:54:01   in Public
Das Zweckprogramm hingegen orientiert sich an der Wirkung, die die von der Redaktion bearbeiteten Informationen auf die Umwelt haben @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:53:55   in Public
Das bedeutet, wenn bestimmte Ursachen oder Ereignisse auftreten, reagiert die Redaktion nach den Prämissen, die sie vorher dafür festgelegt hat.22Jedes Subsystem nimmt entwickelt dabei sein eigenes Kondi- tionalprogramm.

Ein anderer strukturbildender Prozess innerhalb der Redaktion ist das „Entscheidungshan- deln“18, das sich analytisch in drei Phasen gliedern lässt: die Kollektion, die Selektion und die Kondensation von Informationen.
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:52:51   in Public    @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
Ein weiterer Integrationsmechanismus sind die „Intermediärsysteme“.17Die Redaktionskonferenz beispielsweise ist ein solches System, die Bilderkonferenz usw. In sie sind die Redakteure in ihrer Arbeits- als auch in ihrer Mitgliedsrolle verflochten.@kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:52:18   in Public
Neben der Mitgliedsrolle füllt der Redakteur gleichzeitig seine Arbeitsrolle aus, die allerdings eng mit der ersten Rolle verbunden ist. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:52:07   in Public
Gleichzeitig entlasten sie den Redakteur auch von persönlicher Verantwortung, eine Tatsache, di e redaktionelles Handeln überhaupt erst ermöglicht, so Rühl in einer Zusammenfassung. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

Dabei handelt es sich um „einen Komplex spezi- fischer, von allen anderen abgesonderter und deutlich herausgehobener Erwartungen“.7 Die Anerkennung dieser Mitgliederrolle ist verpflichtend, wenn die Mitgliedschaft Aufrecht erhalten werden soll. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

Durch die Konstruktion der so genannten „Mitgliedsrolle“5 versetzt Luhmann den Forscher in die Lage, etwa den Organisationsbestandteil „Herrschaft“ auf die Kluft zwischen formaler Autorität und tatsächlicher Macht hin zu untersuchen. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:50:30   in Public
Dieses von Rühl entworfene soziale „System der Redaktion“ geht davon aus, das die Leistung dieses Systems darin besteht, die Komplexität der Umwelt zu reduzieren, um seinen eigenen Fortbestand zu sichern.4Er greift dabei auf die Theorie von Niklas Luhmann zurück, @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002
HeinzWittenbrink   10.11.2021 08:49:23   in Public
Am ausführlichsten wird die Studie von Manfred Rühl behandelt, da dessen Beitrag aus dem Jahre 1969 als eines der wichtigsten Werke zur Redaktionsforschung erschien, dass auch in späteren Beiträgen, wenn auch modifiziert, starke Beachtung fand und zur Weiterentwicklung neuer Forschungsideen diente. @kuhrtRedaktionsforschungTheorieUnd2002

## editorial planning

>     Editorial planning helps you publish or share content at the right times for the right people.

>     authority and maintenance, planning breaks down into two types or categories: content product and editorial.

## handling of unplanned content

> Unplanned Content Update Request Use this form to send content change requests to the web team

## changes of situation

> especially as your business model or priorities change, new competitors come on the scene, or your target audience shifts. When any of these happen, you can use what you learned from this book to do your discovery and adjust your strategy.

## Reviewing content

>   reviewing content as part of your measurement plan

>  a minimum, review each piece of content once a year. You can review everything at once or conduct rolling audits in which a portion of the content is reviewed every month or quarter.

## strategic authority roles and responsibilities

> Strategic authority is given to the person who is ultimately responsible for achieving the content strategy and demonstrating its success. This person needs the authority to tell even the CMO “no” if she comes to the table with a cool idea with no ROI

Now for a sample of this person’s responsibilities:
 * Leads efforts to evaluate and evolve the content strategy as business goals and priorities change
 * Prepares the budget for annual content efforts
 * Determines the staff resources necessary to achieve the strategy
 * Manages the process of creating and aligning on the content road map and communicates decisions to business partners
 * Ensures that content tools, standards, and guidelines are in place to support content creators, reviewers, and publishers
 * Defines content success metrics, ensures that content effectiveness is measured, and proposes content-improvement projects based on measurement efforts
 * Serves as the content advocate and liaison in discussions about web operations, interactive marketing, technology enhancements, and so on


## implementation authority

    Without implementation authority, the strategic vision and related content guidelines don’t get enforced.




    . Strategic authority belongs to the person who ultimately is responsible for the site objectives, resources and budgeting, and content planning.



    two types of authority regarding content: strategic and implementation. Both are important.

Examples of implementation authority responsibilities include:
 * Manages content requests from business partners and communicates decisions
 * Schedules and facilitates day-to-day content creation, review, and publishing
 * Reviews content before publishing and provides feedback to content creators
 * Mentors business partners on content best-practices guidelines
 * Develops and maintains editorial calendars for the homepage and other prime-content real estate
 * Manages the content-maintenance process and trains business partners to audit their own content


## process documentation

![](pics/example-process-documentation.png)

## editorial calendars

time based character of publishing:

>     They create and publish content based on the time of year or season, projected trends, timely topics, and so on. Your organization likely does the same.

    And Content Strategy Tool 15.2 is a collection of editorial calendar templates developed for real clients.

## tracking editorial information

> You probably need to track other information, such as who is creating the content and when it’s due. I recommend doing that in a separate sheet so the calendar view is clean and clear.

## content production inventory

>     The content production inventory is really just your content inventory repurposed to track content creation from assignment to publishing. I

## communication

strategic meetings

> As such, it needs to involve people in more strategic positions. So gather them up. You’ll want to bring in people from marketing, product development, business intelligence, customer insights, creative, user experience, technology, and so on. I recommend you bring this group together at least twice a year to revisit your content strategy. Once you’ve reviewed the strategy and what you’ve been doing related to content,

# Skills and competences

content strategy skillset - tool 15.1

# Tools and guidelines

> To decide what kinds of tools you need, assess team member familiarity with the editorial process and writing best practices, the complexity of your content, the use of outside resources, and your content management model.

#     content playbook

# Workflows

> Workflow refers to the steps people and teams go through to get the work done. Workflows can be wrought with problems for a lot of reasons. The problems usually involve how the processes are engineered, the techn

>     ou have a strategy without a decision-making framework to support it

## Typical problems

  >  No checks and balances exist to make sure content requests are on-strategy, so the web team is expected to follow through on every request that comes in


    Most people are surprised at how little time they really have to do their work because they are spending so much time in unproductive meetings or helping with unplanned requests.

    What causes the scenarios I just described? The problems I’ve seen most often relate to decision-making and factors related to the workflows in place to produce and publish content.

# Task an job descriptions

>     I like to have content creators and publishers fill out a job time-study worksheet



    this very important responsibility.



    product owners frequently spend quite a bit of time reviewing website content or other materials, participating in SME interviews, or making sure published content is still accurate. Rarely have I seen a product-owner job description that include

## Discovering problems with job descriptions

    job descriptions for key roles across the organization




    method of reviewing roles and responsibilities



    options for uncovering problems with roles and responsibilities. I usually start stakeholder interviews by asking a few questions to help understand what people do day-to-day and how that work is assigned and prioritized

# work overload

Sometimes people and teams have way more work than they can realistically accomplish in a 40-hour work week. This problem can occur when organizations completely underestimate how long content work can take or w

# Kommunikation des Workflows

> What matters is that the workflow is communicated to everyone involved with content (and their bosses), the expectations are clear, and the documentation is complete.

![](high-level-workflow-diagram.png)

> Once you define the steps necessary, you can add some detail. When I provide workflow recommendations for my clients, I am sure to cover, in some fashion, the following information:
 What each step is (covered in the diagram) and what happens before and after it. For example, “Proof editor-reviewed and revised content before it is submitted for publishing.”
 Why the step is important to the process to ensure that you communicate its objective and that you don’t over-engineer your process.
 Who is completing the tasks associated with each step and who is informed or consulted (if applicable).
 When the task will be completed, which can refer to the order in which steps occur and how long they take to complete.
 How the task will be completed, which refers to the technology used, such as whether content will be drafted in a Word document or within the CMS. It also refers to the tools and guidelines used to complete the task (which are up next in this chapter).
You can communicate this information as part of the workflow diagram, similar to how Chapter 9 documented the workflow. Or, you can include it as narrative that accompanies the workflow diagram. And really, you don’t need a diagram at all if you’d rather just write out the steps and tasks. The example in Table 14.1 takes the second step from the diagram (Create) and adds detail about each of the tasks (represented by the boxes in the diagram).

## Reviewers

>     Reviewer is a blanket term for anyone besides SMEs and the editors who need to review content before it goes live.

## Editors

The editor is ultimately accountable for the strategic and brand integrity of the content. Depending on your site and content management model, you may have one or more editors. Common responsibilities include:

## Centralized, decentralidecentralized and mixed models

> Decentralized models pose more risks to keeping your content consistent and on-strategy, whereas centralized ones allow you to run a tighter content ship. Which model is right for your organization depends on several factors, including the usability of your CMS,

# Role of the editing team

>     that’s left is to create the content that will bring your strategy to life, maintain it over time, and make smart content decisions moving forward.

# Mapping existing processes

> understand the workflows used for content work, I’ll facilitate an exercise to map out each step. You can do this at a very high level, a very granular level, or a combination of both, depending on who’s in your session and what you’d like to understand.

> may end up doing this several times with several groups of people, depending on how complex your organization’s content processes are. After the exercise, document it electronically for reference and to call out areas of concern or opportunity. A very simple workflow might look something like this:

# Problems in decision making

    problems with decision-making, I use an exercise that requires clients and stakeholders to evaluate their recent decisions. It’s a scoring system they can use moving forward, employing whatever criteria makes sense for evaluating proposed content projects. Simply list the projects in the left column and the deciding criteria in the right columns. Then, devise a simple scoring system. I typically use scores

Untitled section 23

    How to Uncover and Document Problems I typically rely on stakeholder interviews and collaborative exercises to dig into how decisions are made and what processes are employed.

    # Lack of authority

    > Decision-making and Authority Authority refers to who is empowered to make and enforce content decisions. More often than not, the problem with authority is when no one has any.

# Not well-suited work

    Another common problem is people doing work that’s not well-suited for their expertise level or defined roles.

# Ill defined jobs and roles

    task needs to be done that no one believes (or knows) is part of his job

    # role clarity issues

        Some of the most common issues relate to role clarity, skillsets and experience, decision-making and authority, and work capacity.

    Commonly, content problems are symptoms of a lack of clarity around what work to do, who should do it, and what is realistic to accomplish.

    # woman/man power

    Just as important is ensuring you have the appropriate number of people with the necessary skillsets creating and sharing the right content through effective and efficient processes.

    # Editorial processes and content responsibilities

    Now, let’s define the optimal process for your organization to create and publish on-strategy content. The steps in the process emerge pretty clearly when you document the roles and responsibilities.

    In lots of organizations, people are asked to take on content responsibilities that aren’t officially part of their jobs. That’s when content work gets pushed to the bottom of the list. Advocate to get this work added to job descriptions so they have permission to prioritize it.

    # Content owner

        Owner The content owner is the person responsible for ensuring that specific content is accurate and updated.

    # Content/editorial roles

    > You need a certain base set of content roles and responsibilities to create content that helps you achieve your content strategy. (These roles are focused on written content, but you can apply them to visual content, such as videos and infographics, as well.)

# Content management model

Verbindung von Governance und Content Management. Rollen werden in Bezug auf beides definiert. Siehe auch Lisa Welchman zum Team und distribuiertem Teams. Frage: Gibt es nicht immer auch ein erweitertes Team?

    Before you go too far down the path of process and role definition, you need to determine your content management model:

    That scenario occurs because organizations often conflate policy and standards; however, the two areas are not the same. Policies exist to protect the organization. They do not address online quality and how to achieve it—that is the role of standards.

    A digital strategy has two facets: guiding principles and performance objectives. • Guiding principles provide stakeholders with a streamlined, qualitative expression of your organization’s high-level digital business intent and values. • Performance objectives quantitatively define what digital success means for an organization.

    websites. A good digital governance framework will establish a sort of digital development DNA that ensures that your digital presence evolves in a manner that is in harmony with your organization’s strategic objectives. A digital governance framework isn’t bureaucratic and ineffective. Properly designed, a digital governance framework can make your online business machine sing. The proof is out there. Wikipedia is, arguably, one of the most substantively and collaboratively governed websites on the Web, but it is also perceived as a site that fosters a high degree of freedom of expression. The well-defined open standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) enable the World Wide Web to exist, as it is—without which we would not even be having this conversation. And the multiplicity of purpose and diversity apparent on the World Wide Web speaks for itself. Your organization needs its own internal W3C, so to speak, so that departments, schools, lines of business—however you segment your organization—can be free to take advantage of digital channels, but within parameters that make sense for the organization’s mission, goals, and bottom line. In addition, it needs to intentionally design its digital team so that it can work efficiently and productively. And that’s the work of a digital governance framework. This is your chance to establish the foundational framework that will influence the direction of digital in your organization for years to come. Business leaders and senior digital leaders need to get together and establish how to govern and manage digital effectively in their organizations. Now. Through Managing Chaos, you will learn how to free your organization from debate-stalled stagnation around digital development and establish an environment where an entire organization can work together to successfully leverage all that digital has to offer. What Is Digital Governance? Digital governance is a framework for establishing accountability, roles, and decision-making authority for an organization’s digital presence—which means its websites, mobile sites, social channels, and any other Internet and Web-enabled products and services. Having a well-designed digital governance framework minimizes the number of tactical debates regarding the nature and management of an organization’s digital presence by making clear who on your digital team has decision-making authority for these areas: • Digital strategy: Who determines the direction for digital? • Digital policy: Who specifies what your organization must and must not do online? • Digital standards: Who decides the nature of your digital portfolio?

And so we began to experiment with governance models, ultimately landing upon a lead “business council” with supporting cross-functional teams at various levels to help our work be more effective.
