# Intro

* No technophobia
* Different work and life situations
* Limited knowledge

# Two examples

  [ChatGPT Protocol](ai-material.pdf)

# What is generative AI?

* Large Language Models and Machine Learnings
* Chatbots and other applications

# Affordances and limits of generative AI

* "Stochastic parrots"
* Enormous capacity of predicting tokens
* Base: Models of (written) documents in natural languages
* No knowledge representation (up to now in mainstream apps)

# Use in editorial contexts

* Check for compliance with standards: [Make your writing standards … standard - Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/ "Make your writing standards … standard - Acrolinx"), [Case Studies Archive - Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/case-studies/ "Case Studies Archive - Acrolinx")
* Versions for different audiences: [Graphical Storytelling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rdnewslabs/projects/graphical-storytelling "Graphical Storytelling") [@caswellAudiencesAutomationAI2024]
* Automatic writing: [Writing with AI | OpenAI](https://openai.com/chatgpt/use-cases/writing-with-ai/ "Writing with AI | OpenAI")

# 
  
* Reseach in large amounts of documents: [Panama-Papers: "Wir wären ohne die Technologie nie so weit gekommen." | MDR.DE](https://www.mdr.de/medien360g/medienwissen/interview-ki-munzinger-102.html "Panama-Papers: "Wir wären ohne die Technologie nie so weit gekommen." | MDR.DE") [@heesenKunstlicheIntelligenzIm2023]
* Checks for bias: [Analyzing the Panama Papers with Neo4j: Data Models, Queries & More](https://neo4j.com/blog/analyzing-panama-papers-neo4j/ "Analyzing the Panama Papers with Neo4j: Data Models, Queries & More")

# Generative AI and intelligence

* Fact checking is interactive and social
* Differences between generative AI and human intelligence
* Generated texts (and images) are never reliable

# The bullshit problem

> It is just this lack of connection to a concern with truth this indifference to how things really are — that I regard as of the  essence of bullshit.
 [frankfurtBullshit2013]


# 

> Bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require  someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about.  [frankfurtBullshit2013]

# Conclusion

Generative AI can not replace the social processes which establish what is true. Editorial quality depends on the editorial teamwork. This teamwork can be enhanced, but it can and must not be replaced by generative AI.
