## The relevance of the "epistemic crisis"

> The 2016 U.S. presidential election won by Donald Trump followed closely on the heels of the equally shocking success of the Leave campaign in Britain’s vote to exit the European Union. Both seemed to mark an epistemic crisis in contemporary democratic societies. As 2016 was drawing to a close, many in the United States and the European Union saw these events as signals that democracy itself was in crisis, [@benklerEpistemicCrisis2018]

# Algorithmic content production and propaganda

## The universal turing machine: Generation of sequences

> It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence. If this machine **U** is supplied with a tape on the beginning of which is written the S.D \["standard description" of an action table\] of some computing machine **M**, then **U** will compute the same sequence as **M**.[@turingComputableNumbersApplication1936]

## Personalised content curation

> And now imagine an AI model that is capable of generating not just one piece of propaganda, but 100,000 pieces that are tailored to maybe individual readers, and doing that all in real time, much faster than any human fact checker or opponent of propaganda can keep up with.

# Reference chains and truth

## Truth is connected to social practices

> we can now define enunciation: the set of mediating acts whose presence is necessary for meaning; although absent from the statements, the trace of their necessary presence remains marked or inscribed, so that it can be induced or deduced from the movement of the statements.

## Editing as making sure of references

- Sourcing
- Fact Checking
- Double Checking
- Integrating
- Linking

## Paradox of editing for the net

- Multiplication of references
- Explicitness of mediations

## 

**Thesis:** 

The higher the number of (implicit and explicit) references from online content to online content, the more important the transparent relations to social practices.
