 Aufgabe: Wie können wir sicherstellen, dass eine Publikation - als Beispiel: contentstragy.at – nicht als Marketing wahrgenommen wird, sondern als bestmögliche Darstellung ihres Gegenstands?

 Was sind die Risiken? Das Hauptrisiko besteht darin, als eine von unzählig vielen Content Marketing Publikationen wahrgenommen zu werden.

**Editorial**

 

The style of language and the strategy for content delivery and curation.

 

**Branding** (tone, use of company name, use of product names)

 

**Language** (style manual/dictionary, terminology, cultural competence)

 

**Localization** (translation, management, cultural adaptation)

 [@welchmanManagingChaosDigital2015, Chapter: Standards Implementation]
 - Implememtation of standards via the CMS 
 - 

> Certain standards, particularly some editorial and design standards, need to be implemented via other means, such as employee training and education.  [@welchmanManagingChaosDigital2015, Chapter: Standards Implementation]

> Editorial standards should be crafted by those with expertise in Web writing and content strategy. Standards related to publishing and development should be written by those who understand Web content management systems technologies _and_ how best to author content so that it can be effectively moved around and delivered by those systems.  [@welchmanManagingChaosDigital2015, Chapter: Identifying Standards Authors]

> **Make a distinction between digital production and digital governance.** Your digital governance framework is just that—a framework for decision making. It should not be applied to day-to-day production. For instance, just because your core digital team might be responsible for establishing editorial standards doesn’t mean that they have to approve every piece of content that goes on the site. It means that the standards author is responsible for defining the substance of the editorial standard and helping to support an environment where those standards are easy to uphold. Don’t confuse the two. You might develop more tactical levels of governance, like content governance or taxonomy governance, but those are different, more production-focused activities than what have been described in this book.

## _Chapter Eleven. The Revision Process_

  


> Editing is the single most important thing you can do to prepare your work for the web.

## Collaborative improvement


> Call out style choices you made, particularly if there are exceptions to your style guide.
  


## Levels of editing and improvement

  
> _You can also avoid getting into back-and-forth discussions about sentence-level decisions by telling your team what kind of comments you want. We like to think in terms of high-level feedback and low-level feedback.
  
 
  

  
## High-level feedback: development editor
  
> High-level feedback answers questions like these:• Is it clear? Does it make sense?• Does it flow? Are there places where you get lost?• Does it cover the most important topics?• Does anything insult your intelligence or go over your head?• Are there places where you need a story or an example?These are the questions that a developmental editor would answer when reviewing your work._
  

## Low-level feedback: copy editor
  

 > Low-level feedback is more granular and includes comments on convoluted phrasing, confusing messages, misspellings, and grammatical errors.

  



  

  > Use the feedback as a reason to have a meaningful discussion about the text. If you’re going to ignore several comments from someone, you may want to explain why you’re not incorporating those changes.

  

  
> give it one more read-through to make sure your tone flows with your overall communication style
  

  
> Is it clear? Is it friendly? Is it useful\_
 
> writers will be more likely to accept your feedback if they feel like they’re part of the editing process.
  
> \_Watch out for recurring issues and themes as you edit. If you see a writer making the same mistake repeatedly or notice several people making a similar one, think about how to teach them a better way. Mention your style guide gently when it’s appropriate.\_

> \_if your style guide doesn’t cover that recurring issue, it’s probably time to update it.\_
  

> As an editor, your job is to help the reader understand what’s being said, not to be the ultimate style enforcer._

  


  

  

  
> Continue developing your editorial process as you work through drafts and reviews.\_

# Style Guide and Content Types

  

  
> List all of the content types your company publishes (refer to Chapter 3: Make a Plan for a full list). Sort them alphabetically, or try to loosely reflect the order in which people encounter them on your website\_
