<p>We all know these processes, and we all have experience with editorial processes that are not optimal. Conversely, good quality is also related to well-established editorial processes. We also want to gather a lot of our experience today, with the questions:</p>
<p>Which factors outside the editorial office play a relevant role. Where alternatives are possible.</p>

</blockquote>
</section><section id="section-2" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Editorial work is so closely related to content strategy that questions about the difference between the two often arise. From the outside, content strategy can look quite a lot like the sort of editing found in magazines and newspapers. The editorial world, and that of publishing in general, has a lot to offer us. Kissane p.16</p>

<p>They also need someone to decide how best to communicate it, who should make it, and so on—a sort of combination editor-in-chief and air traffic controller. They need a content strategist. Kissane, p.1</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="section-3" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who do content strategy work from within organizations tend to fill roles quite similar to those of a traditional managing editor: they plan and oversee the communication of new themes and ideas, manage schedules, and collaborate with writers and other content producers. Kissane p. 69</p>

<h2>Why editorial is important</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, it is very easy for brilliant information architects (or UX people who do information architecture) to underestimate the importance of editorial planning, voice and tone, and detailed guidelines for content creation Kissane, p. 59</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="editors-cannot-be-replaced-by-specialists" class="slide level2">
<h2>Editors cannot be replaced by specialists</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you rely on internal experts without a dedicated editor and approval process, you’re courting trouble. Kissane p. 66</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="editing-as-necessary-skill-and-craft" class="slide level2">
<h2>Editing as necessary skill and craft</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>But the truth is, none of these tools can replace a skilled in-house editor. If your client will be creating and managing more than a few dozen pages of content, they’ll need an editor or internal content strategist to keep things running smoothly. Kissane p. 69</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="editing-is-about-authority-and-leadership" class="slide level2">
<h2>Editing is about authority and leadership</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Content creation encompasses writing, illustration, information visualization, metadata and text-equivalent production, and interface writing, and is supported by creative direction and old-fashioned editorial leadership. Kissane, p. 62</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="editing-as-continuous-handling-of-complex-situations-with-unexpected-components" class="slide level2">
<h2>Editing as continuous handling of complex situations with unexpected components</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of editorial work lies not in style guides and arguments about grammar, but in the ability to cultivate relationships, manage chaos, and serve readers. It’s not a profession to be learned from books, but these three very different takes will help. Kissane p. 78</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="section-4" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>But real-world editing is much more about crack organizational skills, a habit of developing practical communication ideas, and the ability to deal firmly and diplomatically with the whole crew of people involved in getting a book, newspaper, or website from concept to delivery. Kissane p. 17</p>

<h2>Editors as advocates of the readers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Editors worth their salt work not for writers or publishers, but for readers. Kissane p. 17</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically, it’s only by working tirelessly for our readers that we can genuinely serve our clients and employers Kissane p. 18</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Acting as a user advocate doesn’t make you an impractical idealist. As we’ve learned from our editorial colleagues, if your content doesn’t work for the user, you’ve already failed. User advocacy is simply a way of ensuring that a project achieves business goals. • Kissane p. 47</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="storytelling-as-a-focus-for-editors" class="slide level2">
<h2>Storytelling as a focus for editors</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever corner of the publishing world they come from, editors know how to help other people tell the best, most engaging stories they can tell. Content people with backgrounds in journalism or publishing usually have the basics of storytelling down cold, but the rest of us can learn from the storytelling principles of these fields—from the basics like building a lead that hooks the reader (and supporting it with facts and quotations) to sophisticated techniques for layering in secondary narratives.

<pre><code>websites. A good digital governance framework will establish a sort of digital development DNA that ensures that your digital presence evolves in a manner that is in harmony with your organization’s strategic objectives. A digital governance framework isn’t bureaucratic and ineffective. Properly designed, a digital governance framework can make your online business machine sing. The proof is out there. Wikipedia is, arguably, one of the most substantively and collaboratively governed websites on the Web, but it is also perceived as a site that fosters a high degree of freedom of expression. The well-defined open standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) enable the World Wide Web to exist, as it is—without which we would not even be having this conversation. And the multiplicity of purpose and diversity apparent on the World Wide Web speaks for itself. Your organization needs its own internal W3C, so to speak, so that departments, schools, lines of business—however you segment your organization—can be free to take advantage of digital channels, but within parameters that make sense for the organization’s mission, goals, and bottom line. In addition, it needs to intentionally design its digital team so that it can work efficiently and productively. And that’s the work of a digital governance framework. This is your chance to establish the foundational framework that will influence the direction of digital in your organization for years to come. Business leaders and senior digital leaders need to get together and establish how to govern and manage digital effectively in their organizations. Now. Through Managing Chaos, you will learn how to free your organization from debate-stalled stagnation around digital development and establish an environment where an entire organization can work together to successfully leverage all that digital has to offer. What Is Digital Governance? Digital governance is a framework for establishing accountability, roles, and decision-making authority for an organization’s digital presence—which means its websites, mobile sites, social channels, and any other Internet and Web-enabled products and services. Having a well-designed digital governance framework minimizes the number of tactical debates regarding the nature and management of an organization’s digital presence by making clear who on your digital team has decision-making authority for these areas: • Digital strategy: Who determines the direction for digital? • Digital policy: Who specifies what your organization must and must not do online? • Digital standards: Who decides the nature of your digital portfolio?</code></pre>
